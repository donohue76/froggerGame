froggerGame Arcade Game

Summary:
froggerGame is a variation of the classic Frogger arcade game.

How to play:
Your job is to navigate your hero from the green grass at the bottom on the screen across the grey bricks to the water at the top of the screen. You must accomplish this without getting hit by enemy bugs scurrying across the screen. Each time the user successfully navigates their hero from the grass to the water, without getting hit, the users score and level of difficulty increase by one (1). 
At the start of each game, both the player and enemy bugs will be randomly placed, with the player always starting from somewhere on the grass area, and the enemy bugs starting on the gray surface.

Movement and Controls
Players can use the up/down/left/right arrow buttons on their keyboard to move their player.
